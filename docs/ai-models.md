# AI Models Guide

## Overview

CarbonScope's AI models focus on **practical, achievable innovation** that goes beyond existing static database approaches. The core innovation is **real-time carbon estimation** through intelligent analysis.

## Core AI Components

### 1. Computer Vision Material Detection

**Purpose**: Identify materials from product images to estimate carbon footprint
**Innovation**: Visual material analysis vs. relying only on product databases

**Models**:
- **Material Classifier**: Identifies plastic types, metals, packaging materials
- **Object Detection**: Locates and segments different materials in images
- **Texture Analysis**: Distinguishes between material types through surface patterns

**Input**: Product images (camera or uploaded)
**Output**: Material composition with confidence scores

### 2. Dynamic Carbon Estimation Engine

**Purpose**: Calculate carbon footprint in real-time based on current conditions
**Innovation**: Dynamic calculation vs. static database lookup

**Components**:
- **Supply Chain Modeler**: Estimates shipping routes and manufacturing locations
- **Seasonal Adjustor**: Accounts for seasonal variations (e.g., fruit out of season)
- **Event Impact Analyzer**: Considers current events affecting supply chains
- **Material Carbon Mapper**: Calculates emissions based on identified materials

**Input**: Product data + current world state + material analysis
**Output**: Real-time carbon footprint estimate

### 3. Community Intelligence System

**Purpose**: Improve accuracy through crowdsourced verification
**Innovation**: Self-improving system that gets better with community input

**Features**:
- **Verification Engine**: Processes community feedback on estimates
- **Confidence Scoring**: Weighs community input based on user reliability
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies potentially incorrect estimates
- **Learning Loop**: Continuously improves models from verified data

## Technical Architecture

### Material Detection Pipeline

```python
Image Input → Preprocessing → Material Classification → Confidence Scoring → Output
     ↓
Product Database Lookup (if available) → Cross-validation → Final Estimate
```

### Carbon Estimation Pipeline

```python
Product Info + Materials → Supply Chain Analysis → Carbon Calculation → Community Verification
                        ↓
              Real-time Factors (season, events, location) → Final Carbon Estimate
```

## Model Training Strategy

### 1. Material Detection Training
